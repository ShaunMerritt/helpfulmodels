Contentment without complacency is a framework that I use to strike the right balance between pushing myself and enjoying the journey. Challenging myself and continually gaining confidence in my ability to push through difficult situations is one of my favorite parts of life. It's also a very easy way to burn myself out though. Enjoying and reflecting on what I do is the most effective way to prevent burn out, and this framework ensures I do that while pushing for growth.

At it's core, this framework asks two questions:
1. Am I content?
2. Am I complacent?

At this point, it's important to understand the differences:
Contentment: a state of happiness and satisfaction
Complacency: a feeling of quiet pleasure or security, often while unaware of some potential danger, defect, or the like; self-satisfaction or smug satisfaction with an existing situation, condition, etc.

Contentment can often lead to complacency, but without a state of happiness and satisfaction, it's hard to feel good about the work you do. The danger is in letting it go to my head and avoiding the difficult questions. The sweet spot for growth is somewhere in between contentment and complacency. A state of happiness allows me to wholistically reflect on my challenges and ask questions that demand honest answers. These honest answers often present more opportunities for growth.
