I've been opposed to drama most of my life. During a particularly tense few months of work, however, I was being asked to consistently deliver software in unrealistic timeframes. This led to quite a bit of frustration. One day, an executive that I had a close relationship with noticed my frustration. As a great leader does, he started asking questions about what was going on. As soon as I had vented, and he had gathered enough information, he drew this on a whiteboard:

Along with this drawing, he made it clear that we all have a choice in how we choose to perceive obstacles. The way I had been perceiving this situation was that of the Karpman Drama Triangle (on the left) rather than the reimagined triangle. While it's clear that any organization could leverage this mindset to justify unrealistic expectations, his intention was simply to shake my perspective. If instead of viewing my boss as a persecutor that assigned too much work, I instead viewed him as a challenger that ultimately had not only the companies but also my best interest in mind, what would I do?

After that conversation, I was able to have open and honest conversations with my boss about when I felt pressured. It allowed me to ask why, and if the why was important it allowed me to figure out a how. 

This simple reframe applies far beyond work situations. I often notice people that seem to attract drama. More often than not however, the people that attract the most drama are the ones that are most vocal about it being drama rather than an opportunity for growth. I try to use this model when I am frustrated or annoyed with a particular person or situation. I ask myself:
- What are they trying (intentionally or unintentionally) to teach me?
- What do I need to grow from this experience?
- Who can I learn from in order to accomplish this?

The exercise of answering these questions is often times enough to shift my perspective away from one of frustration and one to compassion with both the situation and myself.
