#model 

Often times, communication breakdowns are the result of a misalignment in expectations. Someone sharing with me may be hoping for someone to listen and empathize, and I may jump into solving their problem. While useful, it's actually not what they were looking for and can lead to something that is upsetting to both parties. 

This mental model provides four different modes of communication and processing that was introduced to me after having a conversation that went poorly. Both the person I was talking with and I left the conversation feeling upset, angry and defeated. Neither one of us had a resolution, and what we were discussing was something important that needed a resolution quickly. 

After learning about this model from Reboot.io, I quickly realized that I was working from one mode, while the other person was working from and expecting another. This model represents the modes that we most often communicate in:

What's interesting is that we not only often communicate in these modes, but we also expect to be communicated with in these modes. My default mode of communication is to address the problem and solve it. If a friend vents to me, I will likely push them to solve the problem or work to find a solution. Sometimes this is what they need, but sometimes they actually just want to be listened to and heard out. Another example is if I present a problem to someone looking for coaching, and they immediately present a solution. Sure, it helps me solve it, but that's not actually what I was looking for, and I missed a great opportunity to get better.

This model can not only help me recognize what mode I am approaching a conversation in, but more importantly it can help me recognize and ask what mode others need. Sometimes before addressing a critical issue or piece of feedback we need to build a psychological safety by addressing an emotional need. Or sometimes we need to jump straight into a solution and forget about the opportunity to coach. Or sometimes we should spend time coaching rather than providing the answer. The point is, we don't always know what others expect, and working to find out is incredibly valuable.

I can use this model before a conversation to be aware of what mode I am going to start a conversation in. I can also use this model during a conversation when I recognize a resistance or sense the conversation going south.
