The ability to see reality clearly is foundational to our ability to generate positive results. Despite knowing the importance of being in touch with reality, we often make assumptions that put us out of touch with it. Further, when we think we are in touch with reality, we don't always ask the questions that can help us confirm or disprove our belief. In the world of business, we can consult our metrics, numbers that help us get in touch with reality, before making decisions. When dealing with people and emotions, often times the only way to understand someone else's reality is to show empathy and ask to understand.

To establish a clear view of reality, it's important to create cornerstones that you can rely on. In business these are the metrics and benchmarks that you measure your business and your success by. In relationships, this is the foundation of psychological safety and honesty coupled with a deep desire to understand your partners feelings. 

Even with metrics, I often find that reality can be distored. This is often the case in the A/B test gone wrong. We rely on metrics to make decisions that don't include the qualitative side. In a way, this is where seeing reality in business and relationships intersects. There is a metric (ie, how long have we been dating), and there is a feeling (ie, how deep is this relationship), where one does not indicate the answer to the other. If you can build an empathy to help see your partners reality, it will help in building an empathy than can be used to clarify the reality of metrics and benchmarks. 

Biases, mental models, and experiences can all impact my view of reality. This is definitely one of the double edged swords of mental models. To get around this, I seek other perspectives and ask to understand their version of reality for the same situation. Oftentimes it's different, and if we can understand how, we can get an even clearer picture of the actual reality. Getting to this reality as a team ensures that you are not missing something. It makes sure that whatever step you take next, you are making it with an understanding of what is actually happening. 

The 15 Commitments of Conscious Leadership, summarizes this well as "The team that sees reality the best wins."
