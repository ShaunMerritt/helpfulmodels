For some, giving critical feedback is easy. For others, giving positive feedback is easy. Rarely can someone balance the two. The leaders that can celebrate in your success and coach you in your weaknesses inspire huge growth. The ability to balance feedback so that people aren't discouraged or skeptical is a difficult skillset. Yet it's one that leads to powerful alignment. 

Leaders that are quick to provide critical feedback while slow to provide positive feedback often create a feeling of unappreciation which can lead to resentment preventing growth. The flip side however, is just as dangerous. A relationship that indexes on positive feedback can create a sense of skepticism and make it harder to accept critical feedback when it does arrive. Being out of balance in feedback can lead to tense relationships in any form.

Recognizing which relationships are out of balance will allow you to begin the process of restoring balance. Restoring balance can be a challenging process because it's a shock to both you and the person you are in relationship with. It's exactly because this process is so hard that it's important to do. It all starts with the question: which of my relationships are out of balance when it comes to feedback?

The model of balanced feedback came from Randall Stutman during a Knowledge Project episode: https://fs.blog/knowledge-podcast/randall-stutman/
