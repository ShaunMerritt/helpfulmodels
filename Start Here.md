# Hi, I'm Shaun.
Helpful Models is a growing collection of [[Mental Models]], [[Systems]], and [[Essays]] that enable me to think clearly. 

From an early age, I got a thrill by throwing myself at hard problems to solve. I enjoy the struggle and challenge, but most of all I love the feeling of growth that comes from accomplishing something worth doing. I quickly realized that throwing myself in at the deep end is how I learn best. I gained confidence in my ability to learn anything I put my mind to given enough time. 

In our fast paced world though, I realized there's not enough time to learn the things I wanted to learn. Instead, I needed to learn by doing with others. Ideally others much smarter than me that can mentor me. From this point forward, I did and continue to do everything I can to work with people that I can learn from. 

Working with and learning from the mentors in my life has yielded in tremendous growth both personally and professionally for me. My favorite part of working with others is learning the different lenses through which they view the world or a particular problem. These lens' form [[Mental Models]] that allow them to approach new problems with a clarity that would have otherwise taken time. 

This site is meant to be a living repository of helpful models I've learned from mentors and provide examples of using them to further my growth.
